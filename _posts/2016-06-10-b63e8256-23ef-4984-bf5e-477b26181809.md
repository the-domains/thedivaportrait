**Our Training Philosophy**

Training | Behavior | Exercise

## I have owned and trained German Shepard dogs for over 18 years. My first German Shepard, Cheyenne, was certified as a service dog and was my constant companion for over 13 years. Many of the training practices that I utilize are honed and informed by my relationship with my "pack." Our training sessions provide you with simple, common sense tools and techniques that establish rules, limitations and boundaries for your pet. When these techniques are properly, and consistently applied, we then have the possibility of a socialized dog.

_"Unlike humans, a dog will never follow a weak pack leader"._
